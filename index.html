              Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
              existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded
              so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
              billion years ago.Credit...

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p class="first">
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.

          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p class="first">
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it
        </p>
        <p class="first">
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
          <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
          with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John
          M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
          ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
          <a href="#">gravitational waves</a>
          — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it
          was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
          old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
          proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
